                The Sufi saint, poet and scholar Shaikh Jamali
                established a khanqah, or Sufi gathering site, at Makli
                and was eventually buried there.[5] <br />The 14th century
                Samma ruler, Jam Tamachi, venerated the saint and
                wished to be interred near the saint, beginning the
                tradition of using <br />Makli as a funerary site. The site
                rose to prominence as a major funerary site during
                under the rule of the Samma dynasty, who had made <br />
                their capital near Thatta.[5] The most architecturally
                significant tombs at the site date from around the time
                of the Mughal era, between <br />1570 and 1640 CE.

                Mohenjo-daro was built in the 26th century BCE. It
                was one of the largest cities of the ancient Indus
                Valley Civilization, also known as the<br /> Harappan
                Civilization, which developed around 3,000 BCE from
                the prehistoric Indus culture. At its height, the Indus
                Civilization spanned <br />much of what is now Pakistan
                and North India, extending westwards to the Iranian
                border, south to Gujarat in India and northwards to an<br />
                outpost in Bactria, with major urban centers at
                Harappa, Mohenjo-daro, Lothal, Kalibangan, Dholavira
                and Rakhigarhi. Mohenjo-daro was <br />the most advanced
                city of its time, with remarkably sophisticated civil
                engineering and urban planning.When the Indus
                civilization went into <br />sudden decline around 1900
                BCE, Mohenjo-daro was abandoned.

                    Different opinions have been given about the history
                    and origin of the hill station. It is said that the
                    medieval Hindu saint, Gorakhnath,<br /> had extensively
                    wandered in hills and the region. According to Nandu,
                    an authority on Sanskrit, Gorakh is a Sanskrit word
                    which means <br />“shepherding of sheep, cow and goat,
                    etc.”

                <p>
                    The shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar was built by Feroz
                    Shah Tughlaq in 1356,[9] expanded by Mirza Jani
                    Beg[10] and his son Mirza Ghazi <br /> Beg of Tarkhan
                    Dynasty, but was not completed until 1639, when
                    Nawab Dindar Khan paved the courtyard with glazed
                    tiles.[11] The silver<br /> work on the gate, the balustrade
                    around the tomb and the top of the dome was gifted
                    by Mir Karam Ali Talpur of Talpur Dynasty.[11] Later <br />
                    on the shrine was decorated with Sindhi kashi-tiles,
                    mirror-work and a gold-plated door was installed by
                    the late Prime Minister of Pakistan,<br /> Zulfikar Ali
                    Bhutto.[citation needed] The inner sanctum is about
                    100 square yards with a silver-canopied grave in the
                    middle, according to <br />Nadeem Wagan, Cutharo silver
                    donated by Sardar Mahboob Ali Khan Wagan (Chief
                    Sardar of Wagan Tribe) on one side of the marble floor<br />
                    is a row of about 12-inch-high (300 mm) folding
                    wooden stands, on which there is a set of copies of
                    the Quran for devotees to read. On the<br /> other side,
                    beside a bundle of incense, are rows of oil-lamps
                    lighted by devotees. Thousands of devotees visit the
                    tomb particularly every<br /> Thursday.[12][13] The shrine
                    is considered being the chief shrine for malangs and
                    qalandars adherents of a distinct Sufi order inspired
                    by <br />the teachings of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar.
