        <p>
            The province forms the bulk of the transnational Punjab region, now divided among Pakistan and India. The provincial capital<br />
             is Lahore a cultural, modern, historical, economic, and cosmopolitan centre of Pakistan. Other major cities include Faisalabad,
             <br /> Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Multan, and Sialkot. Punjab is also the world's fifth-most populous subnational entity, and the most<br /> populous
             outside of China and India. Modern-day Pakistani Punjab has been inhabited since ancient times; the Paleolithic <br /> Soanian culture initially developed in the Soan valley. The Indus Valley civilization, dating to 3300 BCE, was first discovered 
             <br />at Harappa.[5] It features heavily in the Sanskrit-language Indian epic known as the Mahabharata, and is also home to Taxila,
             <br /> the main centre of Gandhara civilization. It is the site of what is considered by many scholars to be the oldest university in the
             <br /> world.

            <p>
                Fort Munro is part of the Sulaiman Mountain range. The range is located in central Pakistan, extending southward about 280
                <br /> miles (450 km) from the Gumal Pass to just north of Jacobabad, separating  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,Punjab from Balochistan.<br />
                 Its heights gradually decrease toward the south, with summits averaging 6,000–7,000 feet, the highest being the twin peaks
                 <br /> (30 miles from the Gumal Pass) called Takht-i Sulaiman, or Solomon's Throne, which legend connects with King Solomon's 
                 <br />visit to Pakistan; the higher of the peaks, at 18,481 feet (5,633 m), is the site of a Muslim Ziyarat (shrine) visited annually by
                 <br /> many pilgrims. The range's eastern face dips steeply to the Indus River, but on the west the range declines more gradually. 
                 <br />Juniper and edible pines abound in the north and olives in the centre, but vegetation is scarce in the south.

            <p>
                The Noor Mahal (Urdu: نور محل) is a Pakistan Army-owned palace in Bahawalpur, Punjab, Pakistan. It was built in 1872 like 
                <br />an Italian chateau on neoclassical lines, at a time when modernism had set in. It belonged to the Nawabs of Bahawalpur
                <br /> princely state, during British Raj.[1] Noor Mehal is one of the hidden gems of Bahawalpur, due to the lack of publicity. 
                <br />The palace is open to public. It is currently in the possession of the Pakistan Army and is used as a state guest house for 
                <br />holding state durbars and meetings with foreign delegations.

            <p>
                The Sutlej or Satluj River (/sʌtlədʒ/) is the longest of the five rivers that flow through the historic crossroads region of Punjab 
                <br />in northern India and Pakistan. The Sutlej River is also known as Satadru.[3] It is the easternmost tributary of the Indus River.
                <br /> The Bhakra Dam is built around the river Sutlej to provide irrigation and other facilities to the states of Punjab, Rajasthan and
                <br /> Haryana. The waters of the Sutlej are allocated to India under the Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan, and are
                <br /> mostly diverted to irrigation canals in India like the Sirhind Canal, Bhakra Main Line and the Rajasthan canal.
